# Microsoft Engineering Feedback

## Why is it important to submit Microsoft Engineering Feedback

Engineering Feedback captures "voice of the customer" and is an important mechanism to provide actionable insights and help Microsoft Product Groups continuously improve the platform and cloud services to enable all customers to be as productive as possible.

> Please note that Engineering Feedback is an asynchronous (i.e. not real-time) method to capture and aggregate friction points across multiple customers and code-with engagements. Therefore, if you need to report a service outage or an immediately-blocking bug, you should file an official [Azure support ticket](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/create-ticket/) and, if possible, reference the ticket id in the feedback that you submit later.

Even if the feedback has already been raised directly with a product group or on through online channels like GitHub or Stack Overflow, it is still important to raise it via Microsoft Engineering feedback so it can be consolidated with other customer projects that have the same feedback to help with prioritization.

## When to submit Engineering Feedback

Capturing and providing high-quality actionable Engineering Feedback is an integral **ongoing** part of all code-with engagements. It is recommended to submit feedback on an ongoing basis instead of batching it up for submission at the end of the engagement.

You should jot down the details of the feedback close to the time when you encounter the specific blockers, challenges, and friction since that is when it is freshest in your mind. The project team can then decide how to prioritize and when to submit the feedback into the official CSE Feedback system (accessible to CSE team members) during each sprint.

## What is good and high-quality Engineering Feedback

Good engineering feedback provides enough information for those who are not part of the code-with engagement to understand the customer pain, the associated product issues, the impact and priority of these issues, and any potential workarounds that exist to minimize that impact.

### High-Qualify Engineering Feedback is

* Goal Oriented - states what the customer is trying to accomplish
* Specific - details the scenario, observation, or challenge faced by the customer
* Actionable - includes the necessary clarifying information to enable a decision

### Examples of Good Engineering Feedback

For example, here is an evolution of transforming a fictitious feedback with the above high-quality engineering feedback guidance in mind:

* Initial feedback - Emailing directly from Teams is difficult
* Making it goal oriented - **Customer is attempting to communicate with their organization by emailing through Teams and is finding it difficult to do so.**
* Adding specifics - Customer is attempting to communicate with their organization by emailing through Teams and is finding it difficult to do so. **There are too many steps to email a Team/Channel. A user must go to Team/Channel, select a channel, click on the ellipsis. This is a clunky process and makes it difficult to centralize work within Teams.**
* Making it actionable - Customer is attempting to communicate with their organization by emailing through Teams and is finding it difficult to do so. There are too many steps to email a Team/Channel. A user must go to Team/Channel, select a channel, click on the ellipsis. This is a clunky process and makes it difficult to centralize work within Teams. **Customer would like an easy way to email a channel or team from within the UI.**
