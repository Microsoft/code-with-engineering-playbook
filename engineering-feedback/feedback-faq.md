# Engineering Feedback Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

The questions below are common questions related to the feedback process. The answers are intended to help both Microsoft employees and customers.

## When should I submit feedback versus creating an issue on GitHub, UserVoice, or sending an email directly to a Microsoft employee?

It is appropriate to do both. As a customer or Microsoft employee, you are empowered to create an issue or submit feedback via the medium appropriate for service.

In addition to an issue on GitHub, feedback on UserVoice, or a personal email, Microsoft employees in CSE should submit feedback via CSE Feedback.  In doing so, please reference the GitHub issue, UserVoice feedback, or email by including a link to the item or attaching the email.

Submitting to CSE Feedback allows the CSE Feedback team to coalesce feedback across a wide range of sources, and thus create a unified case to submit to the appropriate Azure engineering team(s).

## How can a customer track the status of a specific feedback item?

Customers are not able to track the status of feedback submitted via CSE Feedback.  The CSE Feedback process is internal to Microsoft, and as such, available only to Microsoft employees.

However, as a customer, please submit your feedback via GitHub or UserVoice (as appropriate for the specific service), and inform your CSE engineering partner.  The CSE engineer should submit the feedback via the CSE Feedback process, and in doing so reference the previously created issue.  You can follow the GitHub or UserVoice item to be alerted on updates.

## How can a Microsoft employee track the status of a specific feedback item?

## If I submit a feedback and move to another dev crew engagement, how would my customer get an update on that feedback?

## What should I expect/do after submitting Feedback?

## How/when are feedback aggregated?
