# Prometheus

## Overview
Originally built at SoundCloud, [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit based on time series metrics data. It has become a de facto standard metrics solution in the cloud Native world and widely used with Kubernetes. 

The core of Prometheus is a server that scrapes and stores metrics. There are other numerous optional features and components like an Alert-manager and [client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/) for programming languages such as Go, Java and Python to extend the functionalities of Prometheus beyond the basics. 
The client libraries offer four [metric types](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/); `Counter`, `Gauge`, `Histogram`, and `Summary`.

Prometheus metrics format is supported by a wide array of metric tools and services including Azure Monitor, Stackdriver, Datadog, CloudWatch, and New Relic.
