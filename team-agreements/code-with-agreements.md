# Code With Agreements

[CSE](../CSE.md) code with Partners.  
The term Partner may refer to Customer or Partner.

Both teams from different companies gather as one team, with different backgrounds.
This brings diversity and that's the point of the engagement, but the path may be bumpy, especially if rules are blurry or inexistent.
It's also important to prepare for the end of the engagement, when code will still have to be maintained by Partner, and/or open sourced by CSE or Partner.

For all these reasons, both parties need to agree on a few principles.

## Tech Lead Role

The Tech Lead role can be held by one person from CSE, or one person from CSE and one person from Partner.

When the role is played by both parties, they must agree on their respective scopes.
For instance, if Partner is an automotive company and the project is on Azure,
the CSE Tech Lead will lead on Azure (ex: architecture, security, services choices etc.), and the Partner Tech Lead will lead on everything related to automotive (ex: specific software, functional code, security and architectures decisions to follow standards/regulations etc.)

If Partner already have strong habits on software development, having the duo will be very beneficial to make sure
these habits are both respected and challenged (if needed).

## Product Owner Role

The Product Owner role can also be held by one person from CSE, or one person from CSE and one person from Partner. But in most cases, it's better to have a Product Owner on both side.

When the role is played by a duo, both people will work closely together to maintain a unique set of priorities for the backlog.
When it comes to backlog refinement, the Partner Product Owner may have a stronger focus on what needs to be done while the CSE Product Owner may have more ideas on if and how that can be done.

This is a suggestion, and it must be refined and agreed by both Product Owners, based on the context of the engagement.

## Other roles

The team also need to agree on how important it is to have people from CSE or Partner in key activities.
Here are a few questions that should be answered as part of the agreement:

- Do we need to have people from CSE and/or Partner for
  - design reviews?
  - code reviews?
  - pair programming?
- After a first sprint where one person from CSE starts playing the role of Process Lead, do we rotate and switch between a CSE and a Partner Process Lead? In some cases, it might be useful to rotate and switch between a CSE and a Partner Process Lead, but we recommended to have only one person fo the entire sprint, to avoid confusion.
