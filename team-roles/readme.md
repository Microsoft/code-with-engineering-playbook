## Scrum roles

TODO: link to role descriptions

The Scrum Master can also be accountable for PR turnaround, assigning reviewers and following up with them to make sure that reviews are done in a timely fashion.

## Other roles

On top of the roles defined in the Scrum process, defining one or some of the virtual roles below can
help the team navigate specific situations successfully:

- **Merge master**: helps coordinate managing pull requests when there is a steady flow of them being approved that requires merges and pipeline runs. The merge master will decide the order that PRs are merged and is accountable for the completion of all required merges.
- **Guideline champion**: applicable when the work product needs to adhere with specific, detailed, coding or style guidelines that are required by the customer or within the engagement. The guideline champion studies the guidelines and transfers the knowledge to the rest of the team, monitors changes and helps the team to respond to them, connects with the guidelines owners if possible, and plans for any reviews required.
