# CSE Code-With Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook

An engineer working for a [CSE](./CSE.md) project...

* Has responsibilities to their team â€“ mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This our playbook. All contributions welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request to get involved.

## Outline

The following outlines each section and its contents.

### Goals

The proposed outline is intended to accomplish the following goals

1. Organize for quick reference and discoverability.
2. Define content with a logical structure which reflects the engineering process (our Agile Lifecycle below).
3. Extensible hierarchy to allow teams to share deep subject matter expertise.

### Agile Lifecycle

Our Agile Lifecycle is rooted in CSE's one week sprint cycle, though the ordering and general guidance should still easily apply to sprint cycles of any reasonable length. Each section within then allows for deep dive information, recipes, and use cases.
