# CSE Code-With Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook

An engineer working for a [CSE](./CSE.md) project...

* Has responsibilities to their team â€“ mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically (this is what most people think of as a "developer").
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is the playbook. You are invited to contribute via standard git pull requests to GitHub.

## Outline

The following outlines each section and what content would be included within each section.

### Goals

The proposed outline is intended to accomplish the following goals

1. Author as idea-to-delivery value stream narrative from an engineering perspective.
2. Organize for quick reference and discoverability.
3. Extensible heirarchy to allow teams to share deep subject matter expertise.

### Working Heirarchy

The working heirarchy is rooted in CSE's one week sprint cycle. Each section within then allows for deep dive information, recipes, and use cases.

      - Can the story be tested as written
      - Can it be completed within a sprint
      - Is it dependent on other stories
    - Estimation
      - Resolving estimation conflicts (two people are sizing differently))

### Structure/Pattern

At a conceptual level each section consist of the following parts

1. Conceptual Overview
   1. Explain why this will positively impact the project
   2. What are potential consequences of not using this in my project?
   3. Describe how the concept works
2. Double-Click
   1. Dive into specific areas of whats described in the conceptual overview (i.e Grooming > Estimation > establish baseline estimates)
3. Recipes
   1. Tool specific implementations of the concept
   2. Named patterns or games that implement the concept (usually applies to agile cermonies)
4. Case Studies
   1. Specific project examples how teams implemented the concept
   2. What problem was the team try to solve with their implementation?
   3. What worked well?
   4. Opportunities for improvement
   5. External Reference Material (???)

### Example Directory Heirarchy

The following illustrates how the directory structure could be organized.

```
- /continuous-integration
    - README.md (Conceptual)
    - /e2e-testing-in-ci
        - README.md
    - /static-code-analysis

    - /recipes
        - /azure-devops
            - versioning-ci-builds-in-azure-devops.md
            - sonar-qube-integration.md
