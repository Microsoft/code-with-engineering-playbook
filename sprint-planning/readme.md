# Planning

## Goals

During the [sprint planning](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/sprint-planning), the team discusses and agrees on the scope for the upcoming sprint. 

**Goals are:**
- Selecting the **stories** that will be implemented in the sprint.
- Estimating the **effort** required for the stories in the sprint.
- Splitting the stories into **tasks**.

General guidance:
- The sprint planning should happen at the begining of the new sprint (or at the end of the previous one). It usually last bewteen 1 and 4 hours depending on the size of the team and duration of the sprints.
- Each story should be achievable in the sprint. Otherwise, you should split the story.
- Each task duration should be somewhere between 2 to 8 hours.

## Participation

**Everyone** in the team should participate in the sprint planning.

**Specific roles:**
- **[Scrum Master](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum-master)**: 
  - Facilitates the conversation.
  - Ensures everyone is heard.
  - Reminds scrums principles and sprint planning goals if necessary.
- **[Product owner](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/product-owner/)**: 
  - Prior to the sprint planning: performs some [backlog grooming](../backlog-management/grooming/readme.md) to ensure that each story that they want to propose for the new sprint (*) :
     - Is in the correct position in the backlog, by right priority order.
     - Contains a clear description.
     - Contains a clear [definition of done](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-done/).
     - Do NOT pre assigns stories to the future sprint. This is the purpose of the sprint planning.
  - During the meeting: 
    - Describes to the team the stories that they propose for the sprint.
-  **All team members**:
   - Listen to the product owner story description.
   - Ask questions to make sure everyone understands each story properly.
   - [Estimate](./estimation/readme.md) the effort for each backlog item, as a team. 
   - Split each story into tasks.
   - (Optional) self assign first task to team members.

*(\*) some teams find useful to define a **[Definition of ready](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-ready)** that describes the list of things that needs to be done in each story before the **product owner** can propose it for a **print**. The list proposed here is the classic minimal definition of ready.*

## Impact

**Sprint planning key benefits:**
- Everyone participates, the entire team is aware of the scope of the sprint.
- Each team member takes responsibility in the sprint scope by participating in the stories discovery, sign up, prioritization and estimation.
- Creates a platform to communicate, discover and discuss dependencies.

## Measures

- How many stories needed more work before being presented (and were rejected because not clear enough)?
- How realistic was the estimation of effort?
- Team satisfaction (can be assessed during the retrospective): does everyone in the team feel included in sprint planning?

## Facilitation Guidance

**Prior to the meeting:**
- Set sprint goal.
- Make sure the backlog is prioritized.
- Make sure each story that is a candidate for next sprint is [ready](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/definition-of-ready).

**During the meeting:**
- Confirming team capacity. This should be done using the average velocity (number of points achieved per sprint) and removing the project vacations/holidays/off days. If it helps, you can get the daily average velocity, divide by the number of team members and multiply by number of off days.
- Timebox (for instance: half of the meeting for story selection, half of the meeting for task splitting).
- Agree on how much capacity needs to be "saved" for bug fixing (might depend on the sprint).
- Ensure everyone understands each story that is selected for the sprint.
- Ensure everyone participates in story effort estimation.

**Other considerations:**
- Take into account off days (vacations, national holidays, unavailability).
- If the amount of work in a Sprint is is too much to handle, you might want to split into different workstreams. This might require thinking about [scrum of scrums](./../scrum-of-scrums/readme.md) and all related ceremonies.
