# Estimation

When a team adopts agile, the process of estimating new work becomes more effective.
Over time, as the team works together, they get a sense for how to approach the
stories and the effort that will be required to complete each story. With a few
successful sprints completed, the team can start to see patterns of success and
where the team has had failures. The team can start to look at their velocity against
their estimates and begin to predict with greater accuracy what effort will be
needed to complete the next story.

## Sizing

There are many ways to size stories. This is usually where teams get hung up on
finding the balance between sizing that feel "willy nilly" and accurately estimating
the hours to complete the work. It is helpful to remember that this exercise is
to accurately determine what work can be completed in the sprint...not a precise
time allocation for the work to be complete.

To determine sizing, the team will generally pick two or three stories that reflect
a known amount of work of varying size. Usually, a simple, an average and a complex
story will work best. Each story will be given a relative weight based on whether
it is more like one of the "example" stories. Over time, the "example" stories may
need to be revisited if the team feels that all of their stories are average or
complex.

### Planning Poker

Possibly the most popular approach to sizing is called Planning Poker. This approach
assigns sizing based on the fibonacci numbers 1,2,3,5,8,13,20,40. Teams will go so
far as to purchase cards that reflect the numbers and distribute the cards during
the planning session.

The team would usually pick a simple story and assign it a value of 2. Then the
team would pick another story that was more difficult and assign it a corresponding
value...i.e. a 5 would be assigned to a story that is viewed to be more than twice
as difficult as the 2 but not four times as much to make it an 8.

### T-Shirt Sizes

When using numbers, teams start to over analyze what the points should be or they
try to begin to correlate points to hours on the clock. Teams start to pad their
estimates so they can justify their work with their time sheet. When you see this
start to happen, it may be time to remind the team this is about relative sizing
not about hours to complete the work.

One way to do this is to switch to T-Shirt sizing. With this approach you have extra
small, small, medium, large, extra-large, and double extra-large. When you remove
the correlation to numbers, the teams remember that their goal is only to determine
how difficult the work is before committing to the work to be done. It also gives
the product owner visibility that what was perceived as a simple task may be more
costly and thus less desirable than a couple of other features of a smaller size.

Another benefit of using a less granular approach is that the team won't spend so
much time trying to come to agreement on the precise measurement of the work. Decisions
on medium or large are easier than deciding a work item is 5 or 8 points. That said
this will also put the agile team leader in the position of converting sizes into
numeric values for the purpose of charting and tracking velocity over time.

## Estimation in Planning

As the continues the exercise of estimating in the planning meeting, it should be
viewed as an exercise in relative sizing of the work. Comparing the expected work
to work that has already been done is helpful for the team to understand how they
view the complexity of the work.

The team estimate how many points the team can deliver in the sprint and the team
makes a commitment for the sprint. During the sprint, the team takes the highest
priority items off of the backlog and works on them to completion. At the end of
the sprint, the team reports the number of story points completed during the sprint.
Over time, the team will get better at estimating the points that each story requires
as well as how many points can be delivered in a given sprint.

### Relative Mass

If there are a lot of stories to be estimated, the team can be overwhelmed doing
this all at once and the process can be long and unproductive. However, because
the stories are estimated relative to each other, it may be easier to do a relative
mass estimation.

For each story, either a card or a sticky note is created. The first card is read
and then placed in the center of the table or board. Then, as each card is read,
the team asks "Is this easier or harder that that card?" and it is placed in either lower
or higher position than the story that already exist on the table. This continues
with each card being placed in a line of difficulty from easiest to most difficult
until all stories are placed. Finally, the team then finds the "breaks" that represent
their relative sizing model and record the estimation for each of the cards in that
grouping.
