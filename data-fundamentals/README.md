# Data and DataOps fundamentals

Most projects involve some type of data storage, data processing and data ops. For these projects, as with all projects, we follow the general guidelines laid out in other sections around security, testing, observability, CI/CD etc.

This goal of this section is to help guide on some of the specifics around how to apply these fundamentals to data projects or data portions of a project.

## End to End and Azure Technology Samples

The [DataOps for the Modern Data Warehouse repo](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/modern-data-warehouse-dataops) contains both end-to-end and technology specific samples on how to implement DataOps on Azure.
