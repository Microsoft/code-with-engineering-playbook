# Pipelines

Pipelines is a way to automatically build and test your code project and make it available to other users. It works with just about any language or project type.

Pipelines combines continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) to constantly and consistently test and build your code and ship it to any target.

There are a few suggestions listed below to keep in mind when creating pipelines for continuous deployment:

1. Keep your pipelines fast
1. Isolate and secure your CI/CD environment
1. Make the CI/CD pipeline the only way to deploy to production
1. Maintain parity with production wherever possible
1. Build only once and promote the result through the pipeline
1. Run your fastest tests early
1. Minimize branching in your version control system
1. Run tests locally before committing to the CI/CD pipeline
1. Run tests in temporary environments when possible
