# Social question of the day

The social question of the day is an optional short question to follow the [three project questions](../readme.md) in the daily stand-up. It develops team cohesion and interpersonal trust over the course of an engagement by facilitating the sharing of chosen personal context.

If the team decides to incorporate a social question-of-the-day into the stand-up, the questions can be selected by the facilitator or sourced from the attendees. The latter is faster and the former will likely result in more diverse questions.

> Tip: having the stand-up facilitator role rotate lets the facilitator choose the social question without burdening any one team member.

## Properties of a good question

A good question has a brief answer with small optional elaboration. A yes or no answer doesn't tell you very much about someone, while knowing that their favorite fruit is a [durian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian) is informative.

Good questions are low in consequence but allow controversy. Watching someone strongly exclaim that salmon and lox on cinnamon-raisin is the best bagel order is endearing. As a corollary, a good question is one someone is likely to be passionate about. You know a little more about a team member's personality if their eyes light up when describing their favorite karaoke song.
