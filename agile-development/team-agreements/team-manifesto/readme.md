# Team Manifesto

## Introduction

CSE teams work with a new development team in each customer engagement which requires a phase of introduction & knowledge transfer before starting an engagement.

Completion of this phase of ice-breakers and discussions around the standards takes time however also required to start increasing the learning curve of the new team.

A team manifesto is a soft contract among team members which summarizes the basic principles and values of the team and aiming to provide a consensus about
expectations from each team member in order to deliver high quality output at the end of each engagement.

It aims to reduce the time on setting the right expectations and providing a consensus among team members as well as clarifying the question of "How does the new team develop the software?"

Another main goal of the manifesto is providing a discussion environment during "manifesto building session" and detect the gaps/differences in certain topics for each member during these discussions.

It also serves in the same way when a new team member joins to the team. It gives a short summary of standards and if the new team member asks any question about any topic, this is a good thing to understand the improvement area and take the required actions.

## How to Build a Team Manifesto

It can be said that the best time to start building it is at the very early phase of the engagement when teams meet with each other for swarming or during the preparation phase.

It is recommended to keep team manifesto as simple as possible, so preferably, one-page simple document which **doesn't include any references or links** is a nice format for it.
If there is a need for providing knowledge on certain topics, the way to do is delivering brown-bag sessions, technical katas, team practices, documentations and others later on.

A few important points about team manifesto;

- Team manifesto is built by the **team itself**

- It can include any technical or behavioural agility topics as soon as team find it relevant

- It aims to have a common understanding about the desired expertise, practices and/or behaviours within the team

- Based on the needs of the team and retrospective results, it can be modified during the engagement.

In Microsoft, we have certain standards to build high quality and well-crafted software as well as to give comfortable/transparent environment to each team member for helping them to reach their highest potential.

The difference of team manifesto from other comprehensive set of standards/practices documents is, it is used to give a short summary of the upcoming way of working and practices to prepare a base before deep dive starts with open discussion environment in an ice-breaker way.

Below, you can find some including, but not limited, topics many teams touch during engagements,

| Topic | What is it about ? |
|-|-|
| Collective Ownership | Does team own the code rather than individuals? And what is the expectation? |
| Respect | Any preferred statement about it's a "must-have" team value |
| Collaboration | Any preferred statement about how does team want to collaborate ? |
| Transparency | A simple statement about it's a "must-have" team value and if preferred, how does this being provided by the team ? meetings, retrospective, feedback mechanisms ..etc. |
| Craftpersonship | Which tools such as Git, VS Code LiveShare, ..etc. are being used ? What is the definition of expected best usage of them? |
| PR sizing | What does team prefer in PRs ? |
| Branching | Team's branching strategy and standards |
| Commit standards | Preferred format in commit messages, rules and more |
| Clean Code | Does team follow clean code principles ? |
| Pair/Mob Programming | Will team apply pair/mob programming ? If yes, what programming styles are suitable for the team ? |
| Release Process | Principles around release proicess such as quality gates, reviewing process ...etc. |
| Code Review | Any rule for code reviewing such as min number of reviewers, team rules ...etc. |
| Action Readiness | How the backlog will be refined ? What will be the way for clear DoD and ACs ? |
| TDD | Will team follow TDD ? |
| Test Coverage | Is there any expected number, percentage or measurement ?  |
| Dimensions in Testing | Required tests for high quality software, eg : unit, integration, functional, performance, regression, acceptance |
| Build process | build for all? or not; The clear statement of where code and under what conditions code should work ? eg : OS, DevOps, tool dependency |
| Bug fix | The rules of bug fixing in the team ? eg: contact people, attaching PR to the issue ..etc. |
| Technical debt | How does team manage/follow it?  |
| Refactoring | How does team manage/follow it? |
| Agile Documentation | Does team want to use diagrams and tables more rather than detailed KB articles ? |
| Efficient Documentation | When is it necessary ? Is it a prerequisite to complete tasks/PRs ..etc.? |
| Definition of Fun | How will we have fun for relaxing/enjoying the team spirit during the engagement? |

## Tools

Generally team sessions are enough for building a manifesto and having a consensus around it.
And if there is a need for improving it in a structured way, [Building a Team Manifesto](https://www.scrum.nl/blog/building-team-manifesto/) or any retrospective tool can be used.
