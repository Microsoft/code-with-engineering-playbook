# Inclusion in Code Review

You may be think why care about inclusiveness in code reviews... Below are some points which emphasize why inclusivity in code reviews is important:

* Doing Code Review is an important part of our job as Software Professionals.
* As CSE, We work with cross cultural teams from across the globe 
* How we communicate while doing code review affects team morale
* Inclusive code reviews make new developer comfortable with the team
* Rude or personal attacks doing code reviews are very common, people unknowingly make rude comments in reviewing Pull Requests.


## Types of non-inclusive code review behavior

* Inequitable review assignment
* Negative Inter-Personal Interactions 
* Biased Decision Making

## Examples of Non-Inclusive Code Reviews

* Inequitable review assignment- Assigning lot of PRs to a single person for review and not assigning any PRs for other people in team.
* Negative Inter-Personal Interactions - Long arguments in the pull requests over subjective topics like style of coding.
* Biased Decision Making- Commenting on the developer and not the code. Assuming code from developer X will always be good and hence not reviewing it properly and vice versa.

## Examples of Inclusive Code Reviews

* Anyone and everyone in the team should be assigned PRs to review.
* Reviewer should be clear about what is an opinion, their personal preference, best practice or a fact. Arguments over personal preferences and opinions are mostly avoidable.
* Using inclusing language and tone in the code review comments. For example, being suggestive rather being prescriptive in the review comments is a good way to get the point across the table.
* For the author of PRs- It's a good practise to thank the reviewer for the review if they have contributed in improving your code or you have learnt something new.
* Using the Sandiwch technique, for recommending a code change to a new developer or a new customer, sandwich the suggestion between 2 compliments. Something like- "Great Work so far, but i would recommend a few changes here. Btw, i loved the use of XYZ here, great work!!."

## Responsibility of the author to make code reviews inclusive

* Aim to write a code that is easy to read, review and maintain.
* It’s important to ensure that whoever is looking at the code, whether that be the reviewer or a future engineer, can understand the motivations and how your code achieves that.
* Proactively asking for targeted help or feedback.
* Respond clearly to questions asked by the reviewers.
* Avoid huge commits to submitting incremental changes.

## Culture and Code Reviews

We as CSE, may come across situations in which code reviews are not ideal and often we are observing non inclusive code review behaviors. Its important to be cognizant of the fact that culture and communication style of a particular geography also influences how people interact over pull requests. 
In such cases, assuming positive intent of the author and reviewer is a good start to start analyzing quality of code reviews.
