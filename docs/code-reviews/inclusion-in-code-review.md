## Examples of Non-Inclusive Code Reviews

* Inequitable review assignment- Assigning lot of PRs to a single person for review and not assigning any PRs for other people in team.
* Negative Inter-Personal Interactions - Long arguments in the pull requests over subjective topics like style of coding.
* Biased Decision Making- Commenting on the developer and not the code. Assuming code from developer X will always be good and hence not reviewing it properly and vice versa.
