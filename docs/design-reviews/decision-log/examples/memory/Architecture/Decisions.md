# Architecture Design Decision Log

Not all requirements can be captured in the beginning of an agile project during one or more design sessions.
The initial architecture design can evolve or change during the project, especially if there are multiple possible technology choices that can be made.
Tracking these changes within a large document is in most cases not ideal, as one can lose oversight over the design changes made at which point in time.
Having to scan through a large document to find a specific content takes time, and in many cases the consequences of a decision is not documented.

## Why is it important to track design decisions

Tracking an architecture design decision can have many advantages:

- Developers and project stakeholders can see the decision log and track the changes, even as the team composition changes over time.
- The log is kept up-to-date.
- The context of a decision including the consequences for the team are documented with the decision.
- It is easier to find the design decision in a log than having to read a large document.
