# Record architecture decisions

Date: 01-25-2021

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Not all requirements can be captured in the beginning of an agile project during one or more design sessions.
The initial architecture design can evolve or change during the project, especially if there are multiple possible technology choices that can be made.
Tracking these changes within a large document is in most cases not ideal, as one can lose oversight over the design changes made at which point in time.
Having to scan through a large document to find a specific content takes time, and in many cases the consequences of a decision is not documented.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

We are following [ADR guidance](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook/blob/main/design-reviews/decision-log/readme.md) from the CSE code-with engineering playbook

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.
