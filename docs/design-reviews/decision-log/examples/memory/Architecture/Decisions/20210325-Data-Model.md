# Data Model Architecture Design

Date: 03-25-2021

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to design our graph database to include all information and requirements from the backlog, envisioning session, and design conversations.
The [Data Model](../Data-Model.md) document describes the data model for Memory as a whole.

## Decision

We will implement the agreed upon vertices, edges, and properties as designed in the relevant documentation.

## Consequences

- Because this document just takes a data perspective, the implementation from a business logic standpoint will also need to be designed and implemented separately, to use this data.
