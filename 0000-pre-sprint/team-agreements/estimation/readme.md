# Team Estimation Agreements

## Content TODO's

Reccomend sizing scale such as fibonacci
Pick stories to establish baseline (example below assumes fibnonacci)
    - What story represents 5
    - What story represents 2

Define how to convert points back to hours/days. This is important for capacity planning

Example in terms of single contributor days, assuming 1 iteration = one week sprint (5 days)
1 point     = 0-1 day
2 points    = 2 days
3 points    = 3 days
5 points    = 1 iteration
8 points    = between 1 and 2 iterations
13 points   = 2 iterations or more
