# Machine Learning fundamentals at CSE

This guideline documents the Machine Learning practices in CSE. CSE works with customers on developing and productizing ML models while emphasizing engineering and research best practices throughout the project's life cycle.

## Goals

* Provide a set of ML practices to follow in an ML project.
* Provide clarity on ML process and how it fits within an software engineering project.
* Provide best practices for the different stages of an ML project.

## How to use these fundamentals

If you are starting a new ML project, consider reading through the [fundamentals checklist](ml-fundamentals-checklist.md) or Responsible AI links.

For specific aspects of an ML project, refer to the guidelines for different [project phases](#ml-project-phases).
