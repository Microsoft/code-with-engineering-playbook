# Replacing documentation with automation

## Dev containers in Visual Studio Code

The [Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) lets you use a Docker container as a full-featured development environment. It allows you to open any folder inside (or mounted into) a container and take advantage of Visual Studio Code's full feature set.

Additional information: [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Launch/tasks configurations in Visual Studio Code

To automate startup, installs, etc.

[Tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) in VS Code can be configured to run scripts and start processes so that many of these existing tools can be used from within VS Code without having to enter a command line or write new code.
