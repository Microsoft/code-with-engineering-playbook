# Source Control
There are many different options when working with Source Control. In [CSE](../CSE.md) we use [VSTS](https://csesd.visualstudio.com/_projects) for private repositories and [GitHub](https://github.com/) for public repositories.

## Goals
* Following industry best practice to work in geo-distributed teams which encourage contributions from all across [CSE](../CSE.md) as well as the broader OSS community
* Improve code quality by enforcing reviews before merging into master branches
* Improve traceability of features and fixes through a clean commit history

## Evidence and Measures
- [ ] The master branches are locked and merges are done through PRs which follow the guidelines outlined in the [Code Reviews section](CodeReviews.md)
- [ ] The commit history is consistent and the commit messages provide useful information about the *WHAT* and *WHY* (instead of the *HOW*) of the change.
- [ ] All public repositories follow the OSS guidelines highlighted below
- [ ] No secrets are published or part of the public commit history

## General Guidance
Consistency is crucial, therefore the team has to agree on their approach before they start to code. At a minimum, the team should do the following:
* agree on their **branch**, **release** and **merge strategy**
* agree on tooling for **conflict resolution** and other source control operations (by OS)
  * VSCode extensions
  * [CodeFlow](https://www.1eswiki.com/wiki/CodeFlow) 
* define their approach to commit history (linear or non-linear)
* lock the default branch and merge using PRs
* agree on how to name branches (e.g. `user/your_alias/feature_name`)
* for public repositories:
  * default branch contains the [LICENSE](./Templates/LICENSE), [README.md](./Templates/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](./Templates/CONTRIBUTING.md) file
* minimize code in formats that are not amenable to source control (e.g. Jupyter notebooks) [recommendations being compiled on https://github.com/atg-abhishek/cse-aiethics-ml-best-practices/blob/master/ML_Best_Practices.md will be merged here]

## Q&A
### Q: I just committed a secret - how can I remove it from the git history?
A: use `git reset` to remove them from the commit history. If you already pushed your changes to a public branch, ensure that all contributors that pulled these changes will pull the now updated branch.

  If you have published these changes to a public repo like GitHub, you will first need to change the secrets. Then follow the instructions to [remove sensitive data from a repository](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/). This can be accomplished through the `git filter-branch` command or using the [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) and both options are covered in the instructions.
